"Play fair, play safe" - Shadow: Anti-Cheat

Shadow: Anti-Cheat is a new innovative way to keep exploiters out of your games.
When Shadow detects someone is exploiting, Shadow takes a screenshot of the player and puts them into a quarintine-like state where they can only appeal.
Shadow then sends a discord message via a discord webhook and waits for a moderator to decide their fate.
